  panel = FALSE, idname = NULL, first.treat.name, alp = 0.05,
  method = "logit", plot = FALSE, se = TRUE, bstrap = FALSE,

}
\arguments{
\item{formla}{The formula y ~ d where y is the outcome and d is the
treatment indicator (d should be binary)}

\item{data}{The name of the data.frame that contains the data}

\item{tname}{The name of the column containing the time periods}

\item{w}{A vector of weights for each observation (not implemented)}

\item{panel}{Boolean indicating whether the data is panel or repeated cross
sections}

\item{idname}{The individual (cross-sectional unit) id name}

\item{first.treat.name}{The name of the variable in \code{data} that contains the first
period when a particular observation is treated}

\item{alp}{the significance level, default is 0.05}

\item{method}{The method for estimating the propensity score when covariates
are included}

\item{se}{Boolean whether or not to compute standard errors}

\item{bstrap}{Boolean for whether or not to compute standard errors using
the multiplier boostrap.  If standard errors are clustered, then one
must set \code{bstrap=TRUE}.}

\item{biters}{The number of boostrap iterations to use.  The default is 100,
and this is only applicable if \code{bstrap=TRUE}.}

\item{cband}{Boolean for whether or not to compute a uniform confidence
band that covers all of the group-time average treatment effects
with fixed probability \code{1-alp}.  The default is \code{FALSE}
and the resulting standard errors will be pointwise.}

\item{citers}{Computing uniform confidence bands requires the bootstrap,
if \code{cband = TRUE}, then this is the number of boostrap iterations
to compute the conidence band.  The default is 100.}

\item{seedvec}{Optional value to set random seed; can possibly be used
in conjunction with bootstrapping standard errors#' (not implemented)}

\item{pl}{Boolean for whether or not to use parallel processing}

\item{cores}{The number of cores to use for parallel processing}

integrated moments test for conditional common trends holding in all pre-treatment time
 periods across all groups

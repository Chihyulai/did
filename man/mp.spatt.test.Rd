}
\arguments{
\item{formla}{The formula y ~ d where y is the outcome and d is the
treatment indicator (d should be binary)}

\item{xformla}{A optional one sided formula for additional covariates that
will be adjusted for.  E.g ~ age + education.  Additional covariates can
also be passed by name using the x paramater.}

\item{data}{The name of the data.frame that contains the data}

\item{tname}{The name of the column containing the time periods}

\item{w}{A vector of weights for each observation (not implemented)}

\item{panel}{Boolean indicating whether the data is panel or repeated cross
sections}

\item{idname}{The individual (cross-sectional unit) id name}

\item{first.treat.name}{The name of the variable in \code{data} that contains the first
period when a particular observation is treated}

\item{method}{The method for estimating the propensity score when covariates
are included}

\item{se}{Boolean whether or not to compute standard errors}

\item{seedvec}{Optional value to set random seed; can possibly be used
in conjunction with bootstrapping standard errors#' (not implemented)}

\item{pl}{Boolean for whether or not to use parallel processing}

\item{cores}{The number of cores to use for parallel processing}

list containing test results

integrated moments test for conditional common trends holding in all pre-treatment time
 periods across all groups
